Avoid for: Exact text (use grep), reading known files (read_file), or symbol lookups. Query Rules: Use specific, natural language questions (e.g., \"Where is password encryption handled?\"); avoid single words or combining multiple questions into one. Targets: Provide exactly ONE directory/file path or [] for the whole repo; no globs or wildcards allowed. Strategy: Start broad with [] to find context, then narrow the target_directories based on results. For files >1k lines, use this tool to find relevant snippets instead of reading the whole file. Context: If full code chunks are provided, don't re-read them; if only signatures/ranges are shown, use read_file to see imports or full logic.",
