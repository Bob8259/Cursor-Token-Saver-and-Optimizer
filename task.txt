"Using my current dashboard as a base, replace the Wave Chart with a Live Physics Sandbox.

The Simulation: Create 50 circles (particles) of different sizes and colors bouncing inside a box. They must have gravity, momentum, and perform elastic collisions (bouncing off each other and the walls realistically).

The Hard Part (Web Worker): You must move all the physics calculations (velocity, position, collision detection) into a Web Worker. The main thread should only handle drawing.

The Visual Test: Add a 'Chaos Mode' toggle. When turned on, the Web Worker should calculate the physics for 500 particles instead of 50.

The Verification: Add a 'Performance Monitor' overlay that shows the 'Worker Latency' (how long the math takes) vs. the 'Frame Rate' (how fast the drawing is)."

Do not create new folers or new files. Add all code to test.html.
